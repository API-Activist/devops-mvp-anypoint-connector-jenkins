# DevOps MVP Anypoint Connector Jenkins 
This is a simple opensource Jenkins Connector for Anypoint Studio for orchestrating Jenkins Jobs using API-led connectivity in interaction with other systems such as Atlassian Jira, ServiceNow, ALM Octane, BMC Remedy, etc. This connector can also be used to orchestrate an automated release process involving multiple tools to interact with Jenkins.

## Getting started
This Anypoint Studio MVP (Minimum Viable Product) Connector for Jenkins has been built for the MuleSoft Community as a template to reuse and if required further extend. The connector supports 6 operations in this MVP release, which are:
- Get all Job
- Get all builds
- Get last build info
- Get last build console text
- Run job by name
- Run job by name using CURL

## Installation of the MVP Connector for Jenkins
This section describes the installation process for this mvp connector in order to use in Anypoint Studio. 

### Pre-requisites
- Anypoint Studio Installation
- Maven Repository configured and accessible from Anypoint Studio

### Step 1 - Download the MVP Jenkins Connector
- Download Repository as ZIP

### Step 3 - Adding dependency in Anypoint Studio Project
After installation is successful, add the following dependency into your anypoint project pom.xml:

		<dependency>
			<classifier>mule-plugin</classifier>
			<groupId>embrace.devops.connectors</groupId>
			<artifactId>jenkins-connector</artifactId>
			<version>1.1.3</version>
		</dependency>

The current version of this connector is 1.1.3. Once added, save the pom.xml file and your Mule Palette gets updated and you should see the Jenkins connector.

Now you are all set to use the Jenkins Operations.

## Connector Operations - how to use
This section describes, how to use the provided operation for Jenkins Connector.

### Operation 1: Get all jobs
This operation get all configured jobs for the user entered in the configuration. The response is a json object containing **job name and job color**. 

Drag and drop the **Get all jobs** operation into the canvas and provide the configuration of Jenkins.

**Example response (containing 2 jobs)**:

  {
  
      "_class": "hudson.model.Hudson",
      "jobs": [
          {
              "_class": "hudson.model.FreeStyleProject",
              "name": "Anypoint-maven-demo",
              "color": "blue"
          },
          {
              "_class": "hudson.model.FreeStyleProject",
              "name": "Anypoint_MVP_Jenkins_Demo",

Similar to **Get all jobs** configure also the MIME Type to **application/json** for **Get All Builds**

**Example response (containing 3 builds of specified job)**:
  {
  
      "_class": "hudson.model.FreeStyleProject",
      "builds": [

              "_class": "hudson.model.FreeStyleBuild",
              "id": "15",
              "number": 15,
              "result": "FAILURE",
              "timestamp": 1627902990372
          },
          {
              "_class": "hudson.model.FreeStyleBuild",

                      "shortDescription": "Gestartet durch Benutzer API",
                      "userId": "api_activist",
                      "userName": "API"
                  }
              ]
          },
          {},

Different than with the previous operations, this one requires a MIME Type set to **text/plain**.

**Example response**:

  Gestartet durch Benutzer API
  Running as SYSTEM
  Building in workspace C:\WINDOWS\system32\config\systemprofile\AppData\Local\Jenkins\.jenkins\workspace\Anypoint_MVP_Jenkins_Demo
  [Anypoint_MVP_Jenkins_Demo] $ cmd /c call C:\WINDOWS\TEMP\jenkins2065184340071688622.bat

  C:\WINDOWS\system32\config\systemprofile\AppData\Local\Jenkins\.jenkins\workspace\Anypoint_MVP_Jenkins_Demo>echo "This is a test" 
  "This is a test"

  C:\WINDOWS\system32\config\systemprofile\AppData\Local\Jenkins\.jenkins\workspace\Anypoint_MVP_Jenkins_Demo>exit 0 
  Finished: SUCCESS

### Operation 5: Run job with REST client
This operations **Run job with REST client** specified by a job. Job name need to be provided as an property on the operation. This operation executes a jenkins job remotely using the provided Job name.

## Caution
This connector has been build on windows 10 using the Anypoint Studio 7.10 IDE. It has only been tested with Jenkins 2.289.3 on HTTP. HTTPS has not  been tested, but expected to work without further technical issues. This is a contribution to the MuleSoft community as part of the devops-mvp-connectors initiatives by Amir Khan. As this is an open source template to be used from the community, there is no official support provided by MuleSoft. Also if operations are missing, please use the Jenkins Remote API references to implement using the examples provided within this template.
